# MMM-simulation
A simple numerical simulation of a falling object i made for "Mathematical models and simulation" during my studies.
The initial vertical velocity of the object is equal to 0 (that may be changed by uncommenting one line in wykres.py), the drag coefficient does not change with the altitude (may be changed by uncommenting one line in mmm.cpp).
